\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is game theory?}
Game theory (GT) is the field that explores strategic decision making. \\

\textbf{Not GT:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to play Roulette
    \item Whether to buy a given flat
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GT:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to play poker
    \item How to bargain the price of a flat you want to buy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Elements of game theory.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Who are the players?
    \item What are the plaers' possible actions?
    \item Which informattion do players have when making their moves?
    \item What is the lemporal order of moves?
    \item What are the payoffs (ie what are the consequences of decisions)?
\end{enumerate}

In these notes we will formally define the elements of GT, and present examples.

\subsection{Who are we.}

The notes have been put together a team of GT enthusiasts, namely:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [!] Christian Hilde
    \item [!] Charlotte Rossetti
    \item [!] Marta Courto
    \item [!] Nikoleta Glynatsi
    \item [!] Saptarshi Pali
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions \& Examples}

\subsection{Definition of a Normal Form Game}





\subsection{Example: Matching Pennies}

The matching pennies game is a coordination game.
For one player, they win of both players make the same choice, when for the other, they win if both player make a different choice. 
For that reason it is also a zero-sum game, as only one of the two players can win and one player's gain is the loss of the other.
