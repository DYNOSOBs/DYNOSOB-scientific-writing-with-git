\section{Introduction}

\subsection{What is game theory?}
Game theory (GT) is the field that explores strategic decision making. \\

\textbf{Not GT:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to play Roulette
    \item Whether to buy a given flat
\end{itemize}

\textbf{GT:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How to play poker
    \item How to bargain the price of a flat you want to buy
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Elements of game theory.}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Who are the player?
    \item What are the players' possible actions?
    \item Which informattion do players have when making their moves?
    \item What is the lemporal order of moves?
    \item What are the payoffs (ie what are the consequences of decisions)?
\end{enumerate}

In these notes we will formally define the elements of GT, and present examples.

\subsection{Who are we.}

The notes have been put together a team of GT enthusiasts, namely:

\begin{itemize}
    \item [!] Christian Hilbe
    \item [!] Charlotte Roseti
    \item [!] Marta Courto
    \item [!] Nikoleta Glynatsi
    \item [!] Saptarshi Pali
\end{itemize}

\section{Definitions \& Examples}

\subsection{Definition of a Normal Form Game}





\subsection{Example: Matching Pennies}





\subsection{Example: Prisoner's Dilemma}





\subsection{Example: Hawk Dove}
In the hawk dove game, two individuals both compete for a resource of value $v$. 
If they are both doves, they both get $v/2$. If one is a hawk and the other is a dove, 
payoffs are $v$ and $0$, respectively. Two hawks obtain $(v-c)/2$ each, where $c>0$ is the fighting cost.
